# Community Platform

A modern community platform built with microservices architecture, allowing users to share posts, interact with content, and build connections.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MongoDB (if running services locally)
- Git

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Set up environment variables for each service:

Auth Service (.env):
```env
PORT=3001
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/auth-service
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

Post Service (.env):
```env
PORT=3002
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/post-service
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Reaction Service (.env):
```env
PORT=3003
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/reaction-service
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

3. Run with Docker (recommended):
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

OR run services individually:
```bash
# In separate terminals
cd auth-service && npm install && npm run dev
cd post-service && npm install && npm run dev
cd reaction-service && npm install && npm run dev
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_POST_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3002
NEXT_PUBLIC_REACTION_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3003
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
