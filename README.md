# Community Platform Backend Services

A robust microservices-based backend architecture for a community platform, providing essential services for user authentication, content management, and social interactions. This backend system is designed to support various frontend implementations.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MongoDB (if running services locally)
- Git

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Set up environment variables for each service:

Auth Service (.env):
```env
PORT=3001
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/auth-service
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

Post Service (.env):
```env
PORT=3002
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/post-service
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Reaction Service (.env):
```env
PORT=3003
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/reaction-service
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

3. Run with Docker (recommended):
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

OR run services individually:
```bash
# In separate terminals
cd auth-service && npm install && npm run dev
cd post-service && npm install && npm run dev
cd reaction-service && npm install && npm run dev
```

### Testing the Services

You can test the backend services using tools like Thunder Client, Postman, or curl:

1. First, start the services:
```bash
cd backend
docker-compose up --build
```

2. Test the Auth Service (http://localhost:3001):
```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/auth/signup -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"username\":\"testuser\",\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"password\":\"password123\",\"location\":\"New York\"}"

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"password\":\"password123\"}"
```

3. Test the Post Service (http://localhost:3002):
```bash
# Create a post (replace TOKEN with the token received from login)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/posts -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" -F "content=Test post" -F "postType=general" -F "location=New York"

# Get all posts
curl http://localhost:3002/posts
```

4. Test the Reaction Service (http://localhost:3003):
```bash
# Add a reaction (replace TOKEN and POST_ID)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/reactions -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"postId\":\"POST_ID\",\"type\":\"like\"}"
```

## üé® Frontend Development Opportunities

The backend services are designed to support various frontend implementations. Here are some suggested frontend features that can be built using these services:

### 1. User Interface Components
- Modern authentication forms (login/signup)
- User profile dashboard
- Post creation interface with rich text editor
- Image upload with preview
- Feed layout with infinite scroll
- Reaction buttons and counters
- Comment sections
- User profile cards
- Search interface

### 2. Features to Implement
- Real-time updates using WebSocket
- Infinite scroll for posts
- Advanced filtering and search
- Rich media support
- Interactive reactions
- User mentions and hashtags
- Direct messaging interface
- Notification system
